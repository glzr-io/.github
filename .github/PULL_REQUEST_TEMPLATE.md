<!--
Before submitting a PR, follow this checklist:

1. Give the PR a descriptive title.

  Examples of good titles:
    - fix: fix race condition in message loop
    - docs: update readme with new demo gif
    - feat: add new `general.focus_follows_mouse` config option

  Examples of bad titles:
    - fix #7123
    - update docs
    - fix bugs

2. If there is a related issue, reference it in the PR description, e.g. closes #123.
3. Propose your changes as a draft PR if your work is still in progress.
